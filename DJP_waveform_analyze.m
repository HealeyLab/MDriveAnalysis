%% Note
% In order to allow this script to connect waveform to spiking properties,
% the local master file will have the entries indexed in such a way that if
% you loop through each file and through each class (excluding garbage),
% you can reconstruct which index in the local master file corresponds to
% each entry into the master matrix, and therefore which spiking profile
% corresponds to which.
close all;
clear all;

% Get working directory
% Lower branches will have smaller master files (summaries of waveform
% information) than higher branches, which will incorporate the lower
% master files into themselves...at some point. I'm not sure when. For now,
% just make the functionality to create a master file in a particular
% directory.
