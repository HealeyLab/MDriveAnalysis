%% Note
% In order to allow this script to connect waveform to spiking properties,
% the local master file will have the entries indexed in such a way that if
% you loop through each file and through each class (excluding garbage),
% you can reconstruct which index in the local master file corresponds to
% each entry into the master matrix, and therefore which spiking profile
% corresponds to which.
