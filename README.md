# MDriveAnalysis
### A set of scripts to be used alongside wave_clus that sort and plot data acquired from multiple channels.
Because Intan Data is so big, this repo is designed to be cloned into flash drives or hard drives containing Intan data. Pulling from the repo will update the code, instead of having to copy/paste from my computer.
#### Dependencies
![alt text](https://github.com/zeebie15/MDriveAnalysis/blob/master/dependencies.PNG) As you can see, I am using [wave_clus](https://github.com/csn-le/wave_clus) and a file from MathWorks FileExchange: [plotSpikeRaster](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45671-flexible-and-fast-spike-raster-plotting?focused=3816209&tab=function)
